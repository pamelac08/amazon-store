-- Create a MySQL Database called bamazon.

-- Then create a Table inside of that database called products.

-- The products table should have each of the following columns:

-- item_id (unique id for each product)

-- product_name (Name of product)

-- department_name

-- price (cost to customer)

-- stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

-- Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).
